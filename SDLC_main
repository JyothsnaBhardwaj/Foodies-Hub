Foodies-Hub: SDLC for a Food Blogging Page

1. Planning (Understanding the Goal)
Purpose of the Project:
Foodies-Hub will be a platform where food enthusiasts can share recipes, restaurant reviews, food photography, and cooking tips.


Goal: To create a modern, user-friendly food blog with rich content and interactive features (such as recipe cards, comment sections, and photo galleries).


Problem the Project Solves:
Food lovers struggle to find a single platform that offers well-organized recipes, reviews, and food discussions in an easy-to-navigate format.


Team Roles:
Jyothsna- Project Head
Nandita- Designing
Monika- Designing
Mahima- Jss Developer
Vidhita Gupta- Content Writer


Major Milestones:
Week 1: Home Page Design & Basic Blog Structure


Week 2: Recipe Page & Comment System


Week 3: Photo Gallery and Review Integration


Week 4: Deployment and Testing



2. Requirement Analysis (Defining What is Needed)
Functional Requirements:
Home Page:


A clean, appealing landing page with featured blog posts.


Navigation menu with links to different sections (Recipes, Reviews, Gallery, etc.).


Search bar for easy access to recipes and posts.


Recipe Page:


Individual posts for each recipe with ingredients, steps, and a photo gallery.


Option for users to leave comments or reviews.


Review Section:


Users can submit restaurant reviews with ratings and a comment section.


Comment System:


Visitors can comment on recipes and blog posts (use Disqus or a custom solution).


Non-Functional Requirements:
Responsive Design: The website should work on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).


SEO Optimization: Ensure pages are optimized for search engines for higher visibility.


Performance: Optimize loading times for faster user experience (use image compression, minified CSS/JS).


Technical Constraints:
Hosting on Netlify or Heroku (for simplicity).


Using a CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress or custom build using Node.js/Express.



3. Design (Creating a Blueprint of the Project)
Wireframe:
Create a wireframe for each major section:
Home Page: Featured posts section, top navigation, footer with contact details and social media links.


Recipe Page: Ingredients list, instructions, cooking tips, a comment section.


Gallery Page: Grid layout for food photography with hover effects.


You can use tools like Figma or Balsamiq to design the wireframe, or even sketch the layout on paper.
UI Design:
Color Scheme: Use warm, appetizing colors like yellows, oranges, and browns for a food-related aesthetic.


Typography: Use clean, readable fonts like Roboto or Open Sans for text-heavy sections; stylish fonts for headers like Playfair Display.


Images: High-quality images of food for blogs and recipes.


Folder Structure:
index.html – Home Page


recipe.html – Individual recipe pages


reviews.html – Restaurant review section


gallery.html – Photo gallery page


style.css – Styling for the website


script.js – JavaScript for interactive elements


images/ – Folder for all images and media files


assets/ – Any additional resources, like fonts or external libraries



4. Implementation (Coding the Project)
Front-End Development:
HTML: Structure the pages with proper semantic tags (header, section, footer).


CSS: Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout, along with media queries for responsiveness.


JavaScript: Implement interactive features, like a search bar, image sliders for the gallery, and comment section functionality.


Version Control:
Use Git to create a repository on GitHub.


Commit frequently with meaningful messages (e.g., "Initial commit with basic layout").



5. Testing (Ensuring the Project Works Correctly)
Testing Types:
Unit Testing: Test individual components (e.g., recipe submission form, comment system).


Integration Testing: Ensure the comment system works with each recipe page.


User Testing: Conduct tests with real users to gather feedback on the site’s usability.


Test on Multiple Devices:
Ensure the website is fully responsive on desktop, mobile, and tablet.


Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).


Bug Tracking:
Log issues using GitHub Issues (e.g., "Fix button alignment in mobile view").


Regularly address issues and ensure fixes are thoroughly tested.



6. Deployment (Making the Project Live)
Hosting:
Use Netlify for deploying the static files (HTML, CSS, JS).


For back-end (if using a custom CMS or server), deploy on Heroku.


Deployment Steps:
Push all changes to the GitHub repository.


Set up deployment through Netlify or Heroku.


Test the live site for broken links, missing images, and other issues.


Domain:
Buy a domain name (e.g., foodies-hub.com) and link it to your hosting platform.



7. Maintenance & Updates (Improving the Project Over Time)
Regular Updates:
Add new recipes, blog posts, and reviews each month.


Regularly update the photo gallery with high-quality food photography.


Performance Optimizations:
Compress images for faster loading times.


Minify CSS and JavaScript for reduced file sizes.


User Feedback:
Collect feedback through surveys or a simple form.


Incorporate suggestions for features and improvements.



GitHub Action Items for Students
Create a GitHub Repository:


Name it foodies-hub and provide a short project description.


Set Up a README:


Write a description of the website and instructions for setting it up locally.


Document the Project:


Maintain a /docs folder to store design documents, wireframes, and additional notes.


Use Issues for Task Tracking:


Create issues for each new feature (e.g., "Add recipe submission page") or bug fix.


Work with Branches:


Create feature branches (e.g., feature-recipe-page) and merge to the main branch after peer reviews.


Commit Code Regularly:


Write meaningful commit messages, like "Added recipe page layout".


Push and Pull Changes:


Use git push to upload your local changes and git pull to sync the latest changes from the main branch.


Conclusion
With the Foodies-Hub website, the goal is to create a dynamic, engaging platform for food enthusiasts. By following the SDLC process and utilizing GitHub for version control and collaboration, students can ensure the development process is well-organized and efficient.
